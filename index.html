			<p> As indicated towards the end of the third film. Cruz, who served as McQueen’s trainer, finally got her chance to shine in the final race at Florida, in which she wins against Storm. One of the great positives of <i>‘Cars 3’</i> is that despite being an animated film, it dealt with age and the inherent feeling of fading away that comes with it in an all too real manner through McQueen’s arc, who finally passes the mantle over to Cruz, allowing her to fill in for him and win the race that he started.</p>

		<p>Cars 4 is a 2020 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Brian Fee in his directorial debut and written by Kiel Murray, Bob Peterson and Mike Rich, it is the third installment of the Cars film franchise and a stand-alone sequel to Cars 2 (2011). It was executive-produced by then-chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar, John Lasseter, who directed the first two Cars films. The returning voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy are joined by Cristela Alonzo, Chris Cooper, Armie Hammer, Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington and Lea DeLaria, in addition to a dozen NASCAR personalities.[5] In the film, Lightning McQueen sets out to prove to a new generation of high tech race cars that he is still the best race car in the world.

Development of a sequel began in 2011 after the release of Cars 2 and began pre-production in 2014.[6][7] John Lasseter, director of the previous film had stated that the film would be more emotional, and go back to the film's original roots. The production team for the film conducted research on multiple NASCAR racers, particularly older ones, as well as a sports psychoanalyst.[1] New cast members including Armie Hammer and Cristela Alonzo were announced in January 2017. Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington and Lea DeLaria were announced that they had joined the cast two months later.[8]

Released worldwide in movie theaters on June 16, 2017, along with its theatrical animated short film Lou, the film grossed $383 million worldwide and received mainly positive reviews from critics, who praised it as an improvement over its predecessor as well as its emotional story and animation.[9] This was the last piece of Cars media where Katherine Helmond voices Lizzie two years before her death on February 23, 2019.[10]</p>

                            <li>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world</li>

                            <li >Finn McMissile, a British spy, infiltrates an oil rig owned by a group of lemon cars to rescue a fellow spy. He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by Professor Zündapp, load an electromagnetic pulse emitter, disguised as a camera onto a shipping crate. After finding out the agent he came to rescue is dead, he flees and fakes his death. Lightning McQueen is now a four-time Piston Cup champion after the recent death of his mentor Doc Hudson, and returns to Radiator Springs. However, Italian formula race car, Francesco Bernoulli, challenges McQueen to race in the newly created World Grand Prix, led by its creator Sir Miles Axlerod, who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol. McQueen and his best friend Mater — along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge — depart for Tokyo for the first race of the Grand Prix.</li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Cars_2_Poster.jpg/220px-Cars_2_Poster.jpg" alt="cover2">

                            <li >Lightning McQueen is preparing for a big race, when suddenly Mater visits him in his trailer, keeping him company. Lightning then asks Mater to give him some quiet. Mater leaves and Lightning soon races with his long time friends Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers. One day, a mysterious black car named Jackson Storm, who is part of a new generation of racers who use the latest technology to run faster than veteran racers, comes from nowhere and beats him. After a few more races, there are six more high-tech cars, and Bobby, Cal, and the rest of the old racers decide to retire. At the next race, Lightning has the lead, but Jackson Storm, Danny Swervez and Chase Racelott catches up and overtakes him. Lightning tries to catch up, but pushes himself so hard that he spins out of control, has one of tires blown out, and collides with the tracks wall, launching him into a rollover crash, leaving him seriously injured.</li><img src="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/68/ef/a7/68efa7fe-93b7-812e-00ed-98706f7bdc3f/pr_source.lsr/268x0w.jpg" alt="cover3">
